Due to hardware restrictions, not all people are able to enjoy/utilize the same processing power than others. As a result, it might take longer for the one file to get rendered in one computer than the same file in another computer. That means that if you've got a slow computer, you'd certainly not want to use that to render Blender animations. 

However, not all people also have time to upgrade their hardware. And this is where BlenderRenderer comes to play. 

BlenderRenderer runs entirely on the web with the help of Google CoLab, which is powered by their hosted Linux virtual machines.
